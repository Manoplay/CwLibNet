# Craftworld Toolkit .NET

This is a recreation of Craftworld Toolkit in C# .NET code. It takes after [this repository](https://github.com/ennuo/toolkit/tree/cwlib), and is used for our LBP2 PC Port, Craftworld HUB. It can be used in anyone else's projects too. It sucks right now, but we'll be updating it.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CwLibNet.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd CwLibNet

# Build the project
dotnet build
```

## Usage

```csharp
using CwLibNet;

// Your code here
```
